The report does not provide specific regional consequences for North America or Australasia, but it suggests that climate change will have severe adverse consequences for the health and livelihoods of people, ecosystem health, and biodiversity globally.

Increased risk of water scarcity, land degradation, and food insecurity\\n\\nApproximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change, and the impacts are exacerbated by social and economic inequalities.\\n\\nI hope this answers your question!","According to the IPCC Climate Change Synthesis Report (2023), in modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5\\u00b0C (&gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot, global net zero CO2 emissions are reached around the early 2050s. On the other hand, net zero GHG emissions are reached later, with residual emissions of CH4, N2O, and F-gases of about 8 [5-11] Gt CO2-eq yr-1 remaining at the time of net zero GHG emissions. This means that net zero CO2 emissions would be reached before net zero GHG emissions.","Thank you for your question! According to the IPCC Climate Change Synthesis Report (2023), the factors that drive vulnerability to climate change include the temporal characteristics of the risk, the ability to respond to the risk through adaptation, and the presence of significant irreversibility or persistence of climate-related hazards. Additionally, the report highlights that the likelihood and risks of abrupt and irreversible changes, such as species extinction or ecosystem loss, increase with higher global warming levels. These factors contribute to the vulnerability of individuals, communities, and ecosystems to climate-related risks.","The main benefit of combining technology-push policies with incentives for behavior change and market opportunities is that it can stimulate low GHG emissions investment and reduce emissions (medium confidence). Additionally, this approach can also lead to improved sustainable low-emission economic recovery, development, and job creation, as well as broadened access to finance, technology, and capacity-building (high confidence).","To be successful in addressing climate change, several enabling conditions are necessary. These include equity and inclusion in climate action, rapid and far-reaching transitions in sectors and systems, measures to achieve synergies and reduce trade-offs with sustainable development goals, governance and policy improvements, access to finance, improved international cooperation, technology improvements, and integration of near-term actions across sectors, systems, and regions.\\n\\nAdditionally, it is essential to reduce or remove barriers to feasibility, such as economic, technological, and institutional barriers, to deploy mitigation and adaptation options at scale.\\n\\nFurthermore, international cooperation is crucial, and enhancing technology innovation systems can accelerate the widespread adoption of technologies and practices.\\n\\nFinally, a comprehensive and consistent policy package, combining technology-push policies with incentives for behavior change and market opportunities, can strengthen the effectiveness of climate action."]],["reference_answer",["0.0\\u00b0C to 0.3\\u00b0C","Continued global warming is projected to further intensify the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation, and very wet and very dry weather and climate events and seasons.","53\\u201366 GtCO2-eq","Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation.","2.40 million","48 [36 to 69]%","91%","some emissions from agriculture, aviation, shipping, and industrial processes","North America","Climate resilient development will not be possible in some regions and sub-regions if global warming exceeds 2\\u00b0C.","1.5 [1.2 to 1.7]\\u00b0C","Future loss (or sink reversal) triggered by climate change and disturbances such as flood, drought, fire, or pest outbreaks, or future poor management.","0-20 (USD per tCO2-eq)","International cooperation","The sea level rise projections are hosted at https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool and nearly 11% of the 2020 global population lives in the low-lying coastal zone.","Regions and people with considerable development constraints, poverty, governance challenges, limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict, and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods are more vulnerable, and climate change particularly impacts vulnerable groups such as smallholder farmers, children, and pregnant women, leading to cascading biophysical, economic, and societal impacts even in distant regions.","Global net zero CO2 emissions are reached in the early 2050s in pathways that limit warming to 1.5\\u00b0C (&gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot, and this differs from reaching net zero GHG emissions, as the timing of net zero for a basket of GHGs depends on the emissions metric, such as global warming potential over a 100-year period, chosen to convert non-CO2 emissions into CO2-equivalent.","Patterns of intersecting socio-economic development, unsustainable ocean and land use, inequity, marginalisation, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, and governance.","Accelerated implementation of adaptation responses will bring benefits to human well-being.","It works best when tailored to and beneficial for local value chains, when partners collaborate on an equal footing, and when capacity building is an integral part of the effort."]],["id",[159,161,111,218,322,281,38,245,287,279,280,256,339,406,224,327,246,70,292,416]],["content",["meta_data: {&#x27;source&#x27;: &#x27;https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf&#x27;, &#x27;page&#x27;: 34, &#x27;start_index&#x27;: 0}\\ncontent: 69Long-Term Climate and Development FuturesSection 3policies  limit this additional warming and lead to strong bene\\ufb01ts \\nfor air quality ( high con\\ufb01dence ).
